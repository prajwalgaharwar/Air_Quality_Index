# Air_Quality_Index
Python code to create live Air quality map

##IMPORTANT##
You need to get your own API key from data.gov.in to run this code. it is free of cost you just need to create your account

On the first run the program will take some time as it will get coordinates of all the stations
After the first run the coordinates will be saved in a csv file so from the second time it will not take much time

It creates coloured dots based on the threat level of the pollutant at that station
on clicking that dot you can see the pollutant values
